Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 
Hello, My name is Nathaniel but most people call me Nate.  I grew up just outside of Boston but moved here from Jersey City.  I'm just now starting the program in Fall 2020 and my favorite food is Thai.
